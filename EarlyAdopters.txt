At the time of writing, my objective is just to get a system that I can use so that I can finish my book. In particular,
I just need access to DBnomics data so that I can plot it in R. Once the book is done, I will fill out the platform.

For some time, the package may be overhauled a lot as a result of refactoring efforts. Files are moving, disappearing,
etc. as I try to see what is the most logical structure.

The structures are not yet fully in place, but the fetching is built around "databases" and "providers."

- Currently, only a text file database ("TXT") is supported; "MySQL" will be added next. (This will make the platform
interesting...)
- Have DB.nomics, FRED (need free API key), and "user database". The user database allows for library code to create
series dynamically and are accessed by the same interface as fetching.

If you want to extend the capabilities, the package initialisation loads all Python source files (*.py) in the
"extensions" sub-package. This is how the hooks to the DB.nomics and FRED providers are added. Failures on loaded
extensions are noted, but are stepped over. This means that the package will run even if you are missing the underlying
provider/database API's, and you can extend/monkey-patch the framework without touching the source code.
