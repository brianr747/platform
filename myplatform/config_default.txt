# Defauly Configuration File
#
# Managed by configuration.py; uses built-in configparser.
#
# In order to avoid anyone (like me...) pushing their API keys, database login credentials, etc.
# onto GitHub, will have a somewhat convoluted configuration structure.
#
# The procedure is as follows.
# (1) This file is loaded first by configparser (so don't delete it!)
# (2) If "config.txt" exists in the same directory, load its configuration information. This overwrites
#     selected entries, so you need only override defaults that you want. This file does not exist in the repository,
#     and I set .gitignore to ignore it.
# (3) The configuration parameter [ActualConfigFile][FileName] is checked to see if it is the path to
#     a file on the file system. If so, it is loaded.
#
# What I did is place my actual config file outside the repository directory structure, so it will never get checked in.
# config.txt just overrides the [ActualCongFile] value. That is, the contents of config.txt is:
#
# [ActualConfigFile]
# FileName = {Windows Path}
#
#
[ActualConfigFile]
FileName = NA
