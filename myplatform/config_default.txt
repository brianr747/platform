# Example Configuration File
#
# Managed by configuration.py; uses built-in configparser.
#
# In order to avoid anyone (like me...) pushing their API keys, database login credentials, etc.
# onto GitHub, will have a somewhat convoluted configuration structure.
#
# (1) If the file "config.txt" in this directory exists, it is loaded. (The file does not exist in the repository,
# and I have set .gitignore to ignore it.)
#
# (2) Otherwise, this file is loaded.
#
# Then: the [ActualConfigFile].FileName setting is checked: if it points to a file, that one is loaded.
#
# On my system, the actual config file is outside the directory structure, and so it won't get checked in ever...
# That is, config.txt will be:
# [ActualConfigFile]
# FileName = {Windows Path}
[ActualConfigFile]
FileName = NA
[Logging]
# "Default" means in the "logs" directory below myplatform.
