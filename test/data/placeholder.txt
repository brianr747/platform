This directory is where data for unit tests should end up (or sub-dirs...).

Note: we may need to populate this directory with binary files (pickled fetches from providers). These files
will need to be populated for tests that rely on them work properly.

The test writer will have to figure out how to skip tests for which the user cannot get the initial binary download
to work.
